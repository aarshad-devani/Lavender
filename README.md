# Key Features
**Why should you use Lavender? Well, here's some things that set us apart from the competition.**
- *Open-Source* - Open-source code means that you know what's happening when you execute a command. You're essentially in control of something simple like a text animation to something majour like kicking a user.
- *Easy-to-Use* - Lavender was made to be intuitive and easy-to-use and learn. With the simple prefix of a plus symbol (`+`), you can append the basics like `+help` or `+cmds` to go to the advanced like browsing crypto stocks and more.
- *Uniaue Dashboard for UI Configurations* - Some of our commands are unique to just Lavender. Our dashboard (TBA) is made to provide you with an experience like no other.
- *Self-Deployment? No problem.* - Lavender requires few files and is easy to deploy in less than 10 minutes[\*](#footnotes).

# Where'd It Go?
A lot of things in this readme was moved to the documentation as most people don't need build/install guides right away. You can access all of this and more via the documentation [here](https://docs.knoxcorp.me/lavender/).
